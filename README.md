# Project 17, Phase 4 - Weather App

The Weather App is an online application for displaying current weather conditions for a specified location. 

**The API key is not submitted.** You need to add own **REACT_APP_API_KEY** in **`.env`**  file.

### Short description of the application

A user interacts with the application using a keyboard (and mouse) to enter the location for which the current weather is displayed. Users can add as many location cards as they need.
